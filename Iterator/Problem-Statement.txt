Let a person X buy Three Restaurants and merge them to one
1.Diner House
2.Pancake-House
3.Seven-Hills

All three restaurants owners have agreed that they can have similar structure for menu item(name,price,description,isVegetarian)

But problem is that they have implemented their menu using different data structures
1.Diner House (Array)
2.Pancake-House(Linked List)
3.Seven-Hills(Map)

Now person X asked you to create a application for waiter that will show menu for all these restaurants together.

You think of iterator pattern becoz different data structure have different traversal ways and also we dont want waiter to know about the,
implementation of various menus.
